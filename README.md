This is where change summaries, work intentions, and related planning will be written.

Items can now be picked up from the board.
Also, a description appears when items are selected in the pick up menu.
It would be awesome if there were also descriptions for abilities!
##### Change ItemDescriptionPanelController to SelectionDescriptionPanelController.
##### Create a Describable script and attach it to items and abilities alike.
##### Update ItemOptionState, ItemPickupState, and ActionSelectionState to search for a Describable object on each selection, and display the ItemDescriptionPanel for each.

BoardInventory now exists to track items by point, and to associate item indicators with their items.

There is also a method to remove them, but there isn't a battle command to pick items up yet.

##### Add a new "Pick up" command contingent upon items being present at the point, then create a "item pick up state" to list those items, then move them to the unit inventory when selected.

How would you place an item on a tile that can be picked up by moving onto it?
I gave the Tile class an Items property which would store any number of items. When a character drops an item in the ItemOptionState class, the Tile class can move the item from their Inventory to the tileâ€™s items list, as well as reparent the item from the Inventory to the tile. If the tile has any items on it, an item indicator is visible.
How about picking the item up again?

##### Try making an Inventory object for the board itself. Subclass Inventory and have it Add and Remove items in a different way, using an object pool to show and hide item indicators.
